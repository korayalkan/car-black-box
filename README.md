# Black Box For Cars
<hr>
<li>Same as the black box.<br>
<li>There must be a motherboard to collect the data<br>
after using every function. (signals, brakes, shifting etc.)
<li>This program must record voice, especially if there is any cameras or face sensors inside of the car,<br>
black box must record all of it.<br>
<li>Driver might be a killer, guilty, drunk or sad. For cops to understand everything about<br>
the crash or situation, we have to collect driver's data (facial expressions, voice) and car's data (all functions).
